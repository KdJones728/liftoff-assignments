## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Human memories are full of fallacy.  What we remember one second, no matter how self-actualizing, is quickly replaced by a 3rd grade memory of us dropping our lunch tray or an imagined distraction of shiney-thing X.  How do we compete with our brain's ability to deviate away from the thoughts we wish to remember?  This quest is especially difficult whilst consuming new media, whether it be a movie we are watching, a podcast we are listening to, or a book we are reading.  Our novel thoughts approach and are quickly replaced by new content.  Now we can earmark these thoughts using Dogear!  A revolutionary new application that saves both your thought and the place in the media you thought it.  Each user is able to store their own media types, titles, and then add notes.  Later, when life seems less distracting, the User may view and search through these notes.  Connection features between notes and other users is also a possibility.  Wonder no more what could of been and know what is!
